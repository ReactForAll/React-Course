The `Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications` document contains techniques for building fully accessible JavaScript widgets. ARIA has been around for a while now, and many of the accessibilty features were later supported by HTML5 itself. The first rule of ARIA use is "If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so."

For example, there's an aria role for "progressbar", which is used to indicate the progress of a task. The progressbar role is used to indicate the progress of a task.

```html
<div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="50" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">
  50%
</div>
```

But in HTML5, there's a `progress` element that can be used to indicate the progress of a task.

```html
<progress value="50" max="100"></progress>
```

So, the `progress` element is a native HTML5 element that can be used to indicate the progress of a task, and therefore you should prefer to use it over the `progressbar` aria role.

You can read more about when to use ARIA roles and states [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#NOTES).

Note that all aria-* HTML attributes are fully supported in JSX. Whereas most DOM properties and attributes in React are camelCased, these attributes should be hyphen-cased (also known as kebab-case, lisp-case, etc) as they are in plain HTML. For instance let's take an example of an `<input>` element for which we are not specifying a label with `htmlFor`. We can use `aria-label` to specify a label or use `aria-labelledby` where you can specify the id of the element that labels the `<input>` tag.


```tsx
<input
  type="text"
  aria-label={labelText}  aria-required="true"  onChange={onchangeHandler}
  value={inputValue}
  name="name"
/>
```

Let's take the example from the official docs as well, 

```html
<button aria-label="Close" onclick="myDialog.close()">
  <svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" width="17" height="17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="m.967 14.217 5.8-5.906-5.765-5.89L3.094.26l5.783 5.888L14.66.26l2.092 2.162-5.766 5.889 5.801 5.906-2.092 2.162-5.818-5.924-5.818 5.924-2.092-2.162Z" fill="#000"/></svg>
</button>
```

Here we have a `<button>` with only an `<svg>` inside. We can use `aria-label` to specify a label or use `aria-labelledby` where you can specify the id of the element that labels the `<button>` tag.
